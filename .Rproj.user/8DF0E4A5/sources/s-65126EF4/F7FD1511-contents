GLMMadaptive: Generalized Linear Mixed Models using Adaptive Gaussian Quadrature
================
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drizopoulos/GLMMadaptive.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drizopoulos/GLMMadaptive)

Description
------------

This repository contains the source files for the R package <strong>GLMMadaptive</strong>. 
This package fits mixed effects models for grouped (e.g., longitudinal) data under the 
maximum likelihood approach in which the integrals over the random effects are approximated
with an adaptive Gaussian quadrature rule.

The package contains a sinle model-fitting function names `mixed_model()`.
